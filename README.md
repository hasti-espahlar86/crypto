# 🔒 Crypto Utility — Python Cryptographic Toolkit

**Crypto Utility** is a lightweight, console-based Python toolkit designed for learning and experimenting with core cryptographic concepts using only the Python standard library.

This project focuses on clarity, simplicity, and clean code, making it ideal for beginners who want to understand how cryptographic utilities work under the hood.

---

## 📌 Overview

Crypto Utility allows you to perform basic cryptographic operations such as hashing and text encoding/decoding through a simple command-line interface.

It is intentionally dependency-free and written with modular, readable code to encourage learning, customization, and extension.
